# RAG System Technical Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems combine the strengths of retrieval and generation models to improve the accuracy and relevance of responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs).

In traditional generation models, the model relies solely on its training data to generate responses. This can lead to the generation of content that is outdated, inaccurate, or not specific to a particular domain.

RAG systems address these limitations by introducing a retrieval phase. When a user query is received, the RAG system first retrieves relevant information from an external knowledge base. This retrieved information is then provided as context to the generation model along with the user query.

This approach offers several advantages:

*   **Improved Accuracy**: The model has access to up-to-date and authoritative information, reducing the risk of generating incorrect or obsolete content.：
*   **Enhanced Relevance**: The retrieved information is directly related to the user query, making the generated responses more targeted.：
*   **Reduced Hallucination**: By grounding the generation process on external knowledge, RAG systems can reduce the likelihood of LLMs 'hallucinating' (generating factually incorrect or nonsensical content).：
*   **Explainability**: The retrieved documents can be examined, making it easier to understand why the model generated a particular response.：

Key components of a RAG system typically include:

*   **Retriever**: Responsible for fetching relevant documents or text snippets from the knowledge base based on the user query. Common retrieval methods include sparse vector-based (e.g., TF-IDF) or dense vector-based (e.g., Sentence-BERT) search.：

*   **Generator**: A large language model that takes the user query and retrieved information as input and generates the final response.：

The knowledge base can be in various forms, such as a collection of documents, a database, or a knowledge graph. To enable efficient retrieval, the knowledge base is typically pre-processed, for example, by chunking, embedding, and indexing.

In summary, RAG systems significantly enhance the capabilities of LLMs by integrating external knowledge into the generation process, leading to more accurate, relevant, and reliable responses.
