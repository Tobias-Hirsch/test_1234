# `modules/mysql_module.py` - MySQL Database Module

This document describes the `backend/app/modules/mysql_module.py` file, which may contain specific functionalities for interacting with the MySQL database, although database operations in `main.py` are primarily handled through SQLAlchemy's `database.py`.

## Function Description
*   **(To be supplemented)**: If this file exists, it might be used for low-level MySQL operations not suitable for ORM, or to provide direct MySQL connection tools.

## Logic Implementation
Since `main.py` primarily uses SQLAlchemy, this file might be a placeholder or used for very specific MySQL interactions that bypass the ORM. If it contains actual code, it would typically use `pymysql` or other MySQL drivers to establish connections, execute SQL queries, and process results.

For example, a simple MySQL connection and query example:
```python
import pymysql
from backend.app.core.config import settings
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def get_mysql_connection():
    try:
        connection = pymysql.connect(
            host=settings.MYSQL_HOST,
            user=settings.MYSQL_USER,
            password=settings.MYSQL_PASSWORD,
            database=settings.MYSQL_DB,
            cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.DictCursor
        )
        logger.info("Successfully connected to MySQL!")
        return connection
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to connect to MySQL: {e}")
        raise

def execute_query(query: str, params: tuple = None):
    connection = None
    try:
        connection = get_mysql_connection()
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            cursor.execute(query, params)
            result = cursor.fetchall()
            connection.commit()
            return result
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error executing MySQL query: {e}")
        raise
    finally:
        if connection:
            connection.close()
```
