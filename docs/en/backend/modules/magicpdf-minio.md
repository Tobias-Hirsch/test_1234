# `modules/magicpdf_minio.py` - MagicPDF MinIO Integration Module

This document describes the `backend/app/modules/magicpdf_minio.py` file, which may be used to handle MinIO file operations related to the MagicPDF service.

## Function Description
*   **(To be supplemented)**: If this file exists, it may contain file upload, download, or processing logic specific to the MagicPDF workflow, such as triggering MagicPDF processing after uploading PDF files to MinIO, or downloading results processed by MagicPDF from MinIO or other databases.

## Logic Implementation
Since the specific content of `magicpdf_minio.py` is not provided, its implementation details are unknown. However, it would typically combine functionalities from `minio_module.py` and potentially interact with MagicPDF's API.

For example, a possible scenario is:
1.  Receive PDF files from the frontend.
2.  Upload PDF files to MinIO.
3.  Call the MagicPDF API to process files in MinIO.
4.  After MagicPDF processing is complete, store the results (e.g., extracted text, structured data) back to MinIO or another database.
