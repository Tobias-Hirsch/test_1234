# `routers/permissions.py` - Permission Management Routes

This document describes the `backend/app/routers/permissions.py` file, which defines API routes related to system permission management.

## Function Description
*   **Create Permission**: Provides an interface for creating new permissions.
*   **Get Permission List**: Provides an interface for retrieving a list of all permissions.
*   **Get Permission Details**: Provides an interface for retrieving detailed information about a specific permission.
*   **Update Permission**: Provides an interface for updating existing permission information.
*   **Delete Permission**: Provides an interface for deleting permissions.

## Logic Implementation
1.  **Dependency Injection**: Route functions typically use `Depends` to inject database sessions and the current user (usually an administrator or a user with appropriate permissions).
2.  **CRUD Operations**: Implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionalities for permissions.
    *   `@router.post("/")`
    *   `@router.get("/")`
    *   `@router.get("/{permission_id}")`
    *   `@router.put("/{permission_id}")`
    *   `@router.delete("/{permission_id}")`
3.  **Permission Check**: Before executing permission management operations, a permission check is usually performed to ensure that only authorized users can perform these operations.
