# `routers/users.py` - User Management Routes

This document describes the `backend/app/routers/users.py` file, which defines API routes related to user account management.

## Function Description
*   **Create User**: Provides an interface for creating new user accounts (typically used by administrators or during the registration process).
*   **Get User List**: Provides an interface for retrieving a list of all users.
*   **Get User Details**: Provides an interface for retrieving detailed information about a specific user.
*   **Update User**: Provides an interface for updating existing user information (e.g., username, email, password).
*   **Delete User**: Provides an interface for deleting user accounts.
*   **Disable/Enable User**: Provides an interface for disabling or enabling user accounts.

## Logic Implementation
1.  **Dependency Injection**: Route functions typically use `Depends` to inject database sessions and the current user (for interfaces requiring authentication).
2.  **CRUD Operations**: Implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionalities for users.
    *   `@router.post("/")`
    *   `@router.get("/")`
    *   `@router.get("/{user_id}")`
    *   `@router.put("/{user_id}")`
    *   `@router.delete("/{user_id}")`
3.  **Permission Check**: Before performing user management operations, a permission check is usually performed to ensure that only authorized users (e.g., administrators) can perform these operations.
