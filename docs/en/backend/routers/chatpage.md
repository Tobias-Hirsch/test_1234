# `routers/chatpage.py` - Chat Page Routes (Potentially Deprecated or Specific Use)

This document describes the `backend/app/routers/chatpage.py` file. Based on the file naming, it might have been used to provide backend routes directly related to the chat page. However, given the existence of `routers/chat.py`, this file might be deprecated or used for very specific page logic separate from the main chat functionality.

## Function Description
*   **(To be supplemented)**: If this file is still in use, it might provide initial data required to render the chat page, or handle some backend logic related to page loading.

## Logic Implementation
If this file contains actual code, it might include the following types of routes:
*   `@router.get("/chatpage")`: Returns the HTML or initial data for the chat page.
*   `@router.get("/chatpage/config")`: Returns configuration information for the chat page.

Given that `main.py` does not directly `include_router(chatpage.router)`, it is highly likely that this file is no longer actively used, or its functionality has been handled by `routers/chat.py` or directly by the frontend.
