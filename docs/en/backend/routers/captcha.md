# `routers/captcha.py` - Captcha Routes

This document describes the `backend/app/routers/captcha.py` file, which defines API routes related to captcha generation and validation.

## Function Description
*   **Generate Captcha**: Provides an interface for generating image captchas and their corresponding text values.
*   **Validate Captcha**: Provides an interface for validating whether the user-entered captcha is correct.

## Logic Implementation
1.  **Captcha Generation**:
    *   Typically uses a library (e.g., `captcha` or a custom implementation) to generate image captchas.
    *   The generated captcha text is stored on the server-side (e.g., using Redis or session management), and its ID or other identifier is returned to the frontend.
    *   Image data (usually base64 encoded PNG) is also returned to the frontend for display.
    *   `@router.get("/captcha")`
2.  **Captcha Validation**:
    *   Receives the captcha ID and user-entered text from the frontend.
    *   Retrieves the corresponding captcha text from server-side storage.
    *   Compares the user input and the stored text to determine if they match.
    *   `@router.post("/captcha/verify")`
