# `routers/roles.py` - Role Management Routes

This document describes the `backend/app/routers/roles.py` file, which defines API routes related to user role management.

## Function Description
*   **Create Role**: Provides an interface for creating new roles.
*   **Get Role List**: Provides an interface for retrieving a list of all roles.
*   **Get Role Details**: Provides an interface for retrieving detailed information about a specific role.
*   **Update Role**: Provides an interface for updating existing role information.
*   **Delete Role**: Provides an interface for deleting roles.
*   **Role Permission Management**: May include interfaces for assigning and revoking permissions for roles.

## Logic Implementation
1.  **Dependency Injection**: Route functions typically use `Depends` to inject database sessions and the current user (usually an administrator or a user with appropriate permissions).
2.  **CRUD Operations**: Implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionalities for roles.
    *   `@router.post("/")`
    *   `@router.get("/")`
    *   `@router.get("/{role_id}")`
    *   `@router.put("/{role_id}")`
    *   `@router.delete("/{role_id}")`
3.  **Permission Check**: Before executing role management operations, a permission check is usually performed to ensure that only authorized users can perform these operations.
