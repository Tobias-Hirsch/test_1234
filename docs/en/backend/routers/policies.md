# `routers/policies.py` - Policy Management Routes

This document describes the `backend/app/routers/policies.py` file, which defines API routes related to ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) policy management.

## Function Description
*   **Create Policy**: Provides an interface for creating new ABAC policies.
*   **Get Policy List**: Provides an interface for retrieving a list of all policies.
*   **Get Policy Details**: Provides an interface for retrieving detailed information about a specific policy.
*   **Update Policy**: Provides an interface for updating existing policy information.
*   **Delete Policy**: Provides an interface for deleting policies.
*   **Policy Evaluation**: May include an interface for evaluating whether a given set of attributes complies with a policy.

## Logic Implementation
1.  **Dependency Injection**: Route functions typically use `Depends` to inject database sessions and the current user (usually an administrator or a user with appropriate permissions).
2.  **CRUD Operations**: Implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionalities for policies.
    *   `@router.post("/")`
    *   `@router.get("/")`
    *   `@router.get("/{policy_id}")`
    *   `@router.put("/{policy_id}")`
    *   `@router.delete("/{policy_id}")`
3.  **Permission Check**: Before executing policy management operations, a permission check is usually performed to ensure that only authorized users can perform these operations.
