# `routers/user_roles.py` - User Role Association Routes

This document describes the `backend/app/routers/user_roles.py` file, which defines API routes related to managing the association between users and roles.

## Function Description
*   **Assign Role**: Provides an interface for assigning one or more roles to a user.
*   **Revoke Role**: Provides an interface for revoking roles from a user.
*   **Get User Roles**: Provides an interface for retrieving all roles of a specific user.

## Logic Implementation
1.  **Dependency Injection**: Route functions typically use `Depends` to inject database sessions and the current user (usually an administrator or a user with appropriate permissions).
2.  **Association Operations**: Implements adding and removing many-to-many relationships between users and roles.
    *   `@router.post("/assign")`
    *   `@router.delete("/revoke")`
    *   `@router.get("/{user_id}/roles")`
3.  **Permission Check**: Before performing user role management operations, a permission check is usually performed to ensure that only authorized users can perform these operations.
