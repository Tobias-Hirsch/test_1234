# `routers/smtp.py` - SMTP Email Service Routes

This document describes the `backend/app/routers/smtp.py` file, which defines API routes related to SMTP email sending functionality.

## Function Description
*   **Send Test Email**: Provides an interface for sending test emails to verify that the SMTP configuration is correct.

## Logic Implementation
1.  **Dependency Injection**: Route functions typically use `Depends` to inject the current user (usually an administrator or a user with appropriate permissions).
2.  **Email Sending**: Calls functions in the `backend.app.services.email` module to actually send emails.
    *   `@router.post("/test-email")`
